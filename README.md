# A uBlock Origin blocklist for Stacker News

On websites like Hacker News and Stacker News, people post a lot of spam, which gets in the way of the good posts. I found a [blocklist for HN](https://pifke.org/hn.txt), so I've adapted that list to Stacker News.

Reasons for being included in this blocklist:
- News
- Social media
- Social media influencers' personal websites
- Marketing
- Blogspam (esp. Medium, Substack)
- Podcasts
- Video sites
- The post title contains keywords that are inherently associated with spam topics (e.g. politics, Big Tech, product hype, etc).

If you've got improvements for the blocklist (e.g. websites, keywords, syntax for better blocking things on SN), feel free to open an issue.
